This is the base krei.se n' Gin written in TS with (mainly) use of threejs

The base idea is the structure of a directed cyclic graph that runs with a repeat-counter to allow infinte or finite loops through subgraphs that point back to higher levels of the graph.

That's basically it. This design allows a graph structure similiar to the human brain.
