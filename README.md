This is the base krei.se n' Gin written in TS with (mainly) use of threejs

The base idea is the structure of a directed cyclic graph that runs with a repeat-counter to allow infinite or finite loops through subgraphs that point back to higher levels of the graph.

That's basically it. This design allows a graph structure similiar to the human brain.

To make further use of this fractal-like design you can also use the KreiseZeit-class that allows for different time flows within, f.e. make the day run clockwise, but hours run counterclockwise. The time-counter derived from that allow for a new class of music that has parts both running back and forward.

Enjoy!
